# Tradelingo: Hedge Fund at Your Fingertip

## Overview  
Tradelingo is an AI-powered financial intelligence platform that leverages **quantum computing and deep learning** to provide highly accurate stock market predictions and risk assessments.  

The financial market is notoriously difficult to navigate, with **95% of retail investors losing money** due to lack of high-quality insights and access to expert-level analysis. Many existing financial platforms charge excessive fees, such as **Robinhood Gold‚Äôs $1,000/year premium service**, and provide reports that are lengthy, complex, and difficult for the average investor to interpret. Additionally, financial education in traditional institutions is outdated, leaving students without the necessary experience to make informed investment decisions.  

Tradelingo is designed to solve these problems by democratizing access to **Wall Street-grade intelligence** through cutting-edge technology. Our platform provides real-time **market insights, risk assessments, and personalized investment recommendations**, making advanced trading strategies accessible to **everyone‚Äîfrom beginners to seasoned investors**.

## Mathematical Foundations of the Model

### üîç 1. Quantum Time Series Analysis with QTDA + QPE

#### Quantum Time Series Data Analysis (QTDA)
QTDA provides a framework for encoding time series data into quantum states to analyze temporal correlations. To efficiently capture underlying patterns and remove noise, the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** is employed.

**Mathematical Definition of QFT:**

The QFT is defined as:

$$
\text{QFT} : |x\rangle \mapsto \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{\frac{2\pi i x k}{N}} |k\rangle
$$

where:  
- $|x\rangle$ is the input state,  
- $N = 2^n$ represents the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ qubits.

The QFT transforms the time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation, enabling effective periodicity detection and data smoothing.


####  Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
QPE is used for extracting eigenvalues from unitary operators, which plays a critical role in forecasting time series data.

**Mathematical Principle of QPE:**

Given a unitary operator $U$ with eigenvector $|\psi\rangle$ and eigenvalue $e^{2\pi i \theta}$:

$$
U |\psi\rangle = e^{2\pi i \theta} |\psi\rangle
$$

The QPE algorithm estimates the phase $\theta$, which is directly related to key predictive components of the data.

**Key Steps in QPE:**
1. Prepare the initial state:  
   $$
   |0\rangle^{\otimes t} |\psi\rangle
   $$
2. Apply Hadamard gates:  
   $$
   H^{\otimes t}
   $$
3. Perform controlled-unitary operations:  
   $$
   U^{2^j}
   $$
4. Apply the inverse QFT and measure to approximate $\theta$.

### 2. Quantum Graph Algorithm for the Max-Cut Problem

The Max-Cut problem aims to partition a graph $G = (V, E)$ into two sets such that the sum of the weights of edges crossing the partition is maximized.

#### Mathematical Formulation:

Max-Cut can be formulated as the following binary optimization problem:

$$
\max \sum_{(i,j) \in E} w_{ij} \frac{1 - x_i x_j}{2}
$$

where:  
- $x_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ indicates the subset assignment for vertex $i$.  
- $w_{ij}$ denotes the weight of edge $(i, j)$.

---

#### Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

To solve the Max-Cut problem efficiently, we use the **QAOA**, which combines quantum circuits and classical optimization loops.

**QAOA State Preparation:**

$$
|\gamma, \beta\rangle = \prod_{l=1}^{p} e^{-i \beta_l H_M} e^{-i \gamma_l H_C} |+\rangle^{\otimes n}
$$

where:  
- $H_C$ is the **Cost Hamiltonian** corresponding to the Max-Cut problem:

$$
H_C = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} \frac{1}{2}(1 - Z_i Z_j)
$$

- $H_M$ is the **Mixing Hamiltonian**:

$$
H_M = \sum_{i} X_i
$$

The parameters $\gamma_l$ and $\beta_l$ are optimized using classical methods to maximize the expected value of $H_C$.


### 3. Portfolio Optimization via Quantum Max-Cut Results

The Max-Cut solution is leveraged for portfolio optimization by identifying optimal asset groupings that balance return and risk.

#### Mathematical Formulation:  
The classical **Markowitz Mean-Variance Model** for portfolio optimization is given by:

$$
\min_{w} \left( w^T \Sigma w \right) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \sum_{i} w_i = 1, \quad w_i \geq 0
$$

where:  
- $w$ is the weight vector representing asset allocations.  
- $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of asset returns.


#### Integration with Max-Cut Results

To incorporate insights from the Max-Cut solution, we modify the optimization problem as follows:

$$
\min_{w} \left( w^T (\Sigma + \alpha L) w \right)
$$

where:  
- $L$ is the **Laplacian matrix** derived from the graph structure obtained through the Max-Cut solution.  
- $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter controlling the trade-off between expected return and risk diversification.
